* Emacs typing-categories package
When debugging code, it is not unusual to insert print statements and other temporary code in the program to locate the bugs. After locating all of them, it is impossible to undo or revert just the code used for debugging because it will revert the bug corrections too. This package defines a typing category for inserted text. All text inserted belongs to typing-category 0 by default (this can be change through altering the value of 'typing-category-default' variable). It is possible to instruct the package to change the typing-category to a single digit number (0-9). Everything inserted from that moment and after will belong to the new typing-category. Finally a category can be deleted leaving only the characters belonging to all the other active categories.

** Usage example

A very general usage example can be seen in this gif. Debug words represent the extra debugging code added to locate the bugs which we want to get rid of later. Since debug code is spread across all the program we cannot just revert the changes or use region undo with one move. But we wrote all debug code in typing category 1 so we can delete it with one hotkey.

** Installation

This package is not yet available through MELPA.

It can be installed by cloning the package:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
	git clone https://github.com/Dspil/typing-categories.git
#+END_SRC

And then requiring it with:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(add-to-list 'load-path "<path_to_typing-categories_repo>")
	(require 'typing-categories)
#+END_SRC

The keybindings can be set using:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	;; toggle typing category mode
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t t") 'typing-category)
	;; change typing category number (0-9)
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t c") 'change-typing-category)
	;; delete characters belonging to a typing category
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t d") 'delete-typing-category)
	;; set the typing category to the default one
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t r") 'reset-typing-category)
	;; report the current typing category
	(global-set-key (kbd "C-x t p") 'current-typing-category)
#+END_SRC

Or it can be set up using use-package (if you have already added its path to the 'load-path):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
	(use-package typing-categories
		:bind (
		 ;; toggle typing category mode
		 ("C-x t t" . typing-category)
		 ;; change typing category number (0-9)
		 ("C-x t c" . change-typing-category)
		 ;; delete characters belonging to a typing category
		 ("C-x t d" . delete-typing-category)
		 ;; set the typing category to the default one
		 ("C-x t r" . reset-typing-category)
		 ;; report the current typing category
		 ("C-x t p" . current-typing-category) 
		 )
		)
#+END_SRC
